- Domination Tattoo: The Ashalan can imbue others with mystical tattoos similar to those of the Ashalan themselves. They magically bind the creatures to the Ashalan, making them slaves. The process takes 70 hours, during which the Ashalan must make a Craft: Tattooing roll with a TN of 5 x the target's Insight Rank. The target may negate this with a contested Willpower roll.

### <span>Order of the Blood-Red Tiger : +1 Agility</span>

Haroun's enforcers are an affront to the teachings of the Old Man, and they revel in it. They originally served as the enforcement wing of the Dahab and their Qolat master.
