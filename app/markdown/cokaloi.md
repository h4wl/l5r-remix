Title: Cokaloi
---
The specific techniques of the Diviners are referred to as Cokaloi, or &quot;bones&quot;, in their language, because of the deep, funtamental need for each of these types of magic. Without them, a Ra'Shari would be as a man without bones. A diviner may not learn Cokaloi with a mastery rank higher than his Insight Rank.

## <span>The Cokaloi of Dawn</span>

Dawn magic governs fate, and how the ebb and flow of random fortune can affect a person's performance in a task. These are many : there are two for each Skill, a blessing and a curse. They are simple to perform. The Diviner need only exhort those he wishes to bless, or condemn those he needs to curse. Dawn Cokaloi need not be learned in order, a Diviner may know the First Blessing of Athletics and the Third Blessing of Medicine without knowing the First and Second Blessing of Medicine.

## <span>The Cokaloi of Dusk</span>

This magic governs the whims of the mortal mind, and is capable of adjusting a mind's thought and perception easily. This magic was vital for the Ra'Shari to learn, as it has delivered them from upset buyers and angry mobs countless times. Dusk Cokaloi may only be cast upon being with which the Diviner may make vocal or eye contact.

### A Good Friend
- Ring/Mastery: Air 1
- Range: 25'
- Area of Effect: One person.
- Duration: 5 minutes.
- Raises: None.

This Cokalos bypasses the suspension that normally lurks in a person's mind. Even the deeply cynical and jaded will be open to the possibility that the Diviner is a fundamentally good person with useful things to say. Absurd situations end this effect prematurely.

### Propriety
- Ring/Mastery: Air 1
- Range: 25'
- Area of Effect: Two persons or creatures
- Duration: 5 minutes.
- Raises: Area of Effect (+2 targets per Raise).

With a pleasant smile and a word of reassurence, the Diviner reminds one or more unlookers that everything is alright and nothing is amiss.

### Business as Usual
- Ring/Mastery: Air 2
- Range: 25' radius
- Area of Effect: All persons within range.

### I am not Here
- Ring/Mastery: Air 2
- Range: 25' radius
- Area of Effect: All persons within range.

- Range: 25'
- Area of Effect: Any 1 person.
- Duration: 5 minutes.
- Raises: None.

With this Cokalos, the Diviner appears to be an expert on any topic someone wishes to converse about.

### Above Reproach
- Ring/Mastery: Air 3
- Range: n/a'
- Area of Effect: Any 1 encampment or large building.
- Duration: Concentration
- Raises: None.

This Cokalos is the reason why the wagons of Ra'Shari encampments are never searched when a thing or person goes missing. When used on an area containing no more than a hundred persons, this place becomes above reproach. The Diviner may concentrate on the spell spending a Simple Action every turn to maintain the illusion, if he does so the illusion is perfect and cannot be broached short of magical means. Otherwise anyone searching for suspicious behaviour or the like who views the area may still become suspicious if they succeed at a roll using their Willpower / Insight Rank (keeping willpower) vs. a TN of the Diviner’s Spellcasting Roll to create this effect

### Hiding from the Sun
- Ring/Mastery: Air 3
- Range: Self.
- Area of Effect: Personal.

- Range: Self.
- Area of Effect: Personal.
- Duration: 5 minutes.
- Raises: None.

This Cokalos permits the Diviner to appear extremely trustworthy and capable. People who collect Allies will almost certainly seek him up, and those who see him in trouble will be more motivated to assist him. You gain an additional experience point from Obligations earned this way, and Allies you obtain this way cost an experience point less to obtain.

### I am Someone Else
- Ring/Mastery: Air 4
- Range: Self.
- Area of Effect: Personal.
- Duration: One hour.
- Raises: None.

This Cokalos permits the Diviner to appear as an entirely different person, as long as the final image settles on something humanoid (an Ashalan or Naga is reasonable). This illusion adjusts on what happens to the caster, but does not hold on to tactile inspection. It also covers the Diviner's voice if he so desires.

### This is Reasonable
- Ring/Mastery: Air 4
- Range: Self.
- Area of Effect: Personal.
- Duration: Five minutes
- Raises: None.

Th Cokalos allows the Diviner to say anything at all. To those listening, it seems that what he sais is reasonable, correct and inform. It cannot convince anyone to enter obvious danger, but careful wordings can work around the self-preservation instincts of most beings. Those hearing the Diviner may avoid this effect if they succeed at a roll using their Willpower / Insight Rank (keeping willpower) vs. a TN of the Diviner’s Spellcasting Roll to create this effect.

### For All of Us
- Ring/Mastery: Air 5
- Range: Special
- Area of Effect: Special
- Duration: Special.
- Raises: None.

This is not so much one Cokalos as eleven, all refinements of lower-level Dusk Cokaloi. When invoked, it becomes any of the lower-level Dusk Cokaloi with the Area of Effect changed to &quot;Up to 100 willing targets&quot;.

The target may avoid this effect if they succeed at a roll using their Willpower / Insight Rank (keeping willpower) vs. a TN of the Diviner’s Spellcasting Roll to create this effect.

## <span>The Cokaloi of Night</span>

The most secretive of Ra'Shari magics, the Cokaloi of Night are rarely seen by outsiders, since they are almost always cast within the confines of a Ra'Shari encampment. Night Magic is the magic of life and rest, promoting healing just as if a body slumbered peacefully. Night is also the time of roosting, where all beings, not just humans, return home and prepare for the next day. These Cokaloi can only target one person at a time.
