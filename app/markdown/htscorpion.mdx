- 6-7 Your ancestor was supposed to target and eliminate an enemy-either politically or physically. Regardless, he fell in love with his target instead and never completed his mission. Your family has been fighting his legacy ever since. You lose 0.5 Status and gain the Disadvantage Failure of Bushido: Duty.
- 8-9 Your ancestor was in command of a battle that should have been an easy win for the Scorpion. Instead, they were defeated, resulting in many years of lost time for the Scorpion in the courts. You gain the Overconfident Disadvantage.
