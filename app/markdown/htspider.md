D10 Roll result

- 1-3 You were taken from your family as an infant-stolen by the Bloodspeaker Cult, who felt you were a child of prophecy. You never embraced their ways, however, and eagerly betrayed them to the Lost at the first opportunity. You gain the Touch of the Spirit Realm Advantage.
- 4-6 You were abandoned at a monastery as a child, an unwelcome burden on your parents. Your years in the monastery were unpleasant and punishing, but the doctrine of strength and power in the Order of the Spider appealed to you, and you were among Roshungi’s fi rst adherents. You gain the Dark Paragon Advantage.
- 7-9 As a child you suffered from visions. Others thought you were possessed by demons and eventually you were abandoned by your family. The Lost never questioned your value, however, and let you earn your place among them. You gain the Ishiken-do Advantage.
- 0 The other Lost found you as a child, surviving alone in the Shadowlands. No one understands how this was possible and you have no memory of those years. Sometimes, however, you have half-remembered dreams that give you glimpses of what happened&#8230; or what will happen. You gain the Inner Gift Advantage.
