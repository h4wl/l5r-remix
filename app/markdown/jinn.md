Title: Jinn
---
Summoning a Jinn takes an Air roll at TN 5 after six hours of uninterrupting meditation after drawing Hakhim's seal. The TN may be increased if you need a specific type of Jinn, or a specific Jinn instead. Characters of Insight rank 1 et 2 may only summon Minor Jinn, of insight rank 3 and 4 may only summon Intermediate Jinn, and Major Jinn can only be summoned by characters with Insight Rank 5.

### <span>Negotiating with Jinn</span>

In order to negotiate with the Jinn, you may make a contested Commerce / Awareness roll against him. You gain a bonus on the roll depending on whether you are needing&#8230;

- A month's worth of services : +0
- A week's worth of services : +5
- A day's worth of services : +10
- A conversation's worth of services : +15

The result of the negotiation is the following, depending on the summoner's roll and the jinn's roll:

- If your roll is higher than the Jinn's, he asks a minor task requiring only moments, such as speaking favorably of the Jinn or praising him.
- If you lose the roll by 5 or less, he asks a simple task, such as aquiring an item, or destroying an item you hold dear.
- If you lose the roll by 10 or less, he asks an involved task, such as acquiring a dangerous animal, or defeating the jinn in a wrestling match.
- If you lose the roll by 15 or less, he asks a difficult task, such as allowing the jinn to take a work of art, or building a monument in his honor.
- If you lose the roll by more than 15, he asks a monumental task, such as your firstborn son, or sacrificing all your memories.

### <span>Creating a Jinn</span>

All Jinns possess the same basic abilities depending on whether they are minor, medium or major.

- Minor Jinns have all their Rings and Traits at 2, roll 4k2 for attacking and damage, and have Brawling 2 and Commerce 3.
- Medium Jinns have all their Rings and Traits at 3 (except Fire and Void at 4), roll 6k4 for attacking and damage, and have Brawling 4 and Commerce 4.
- Major Jinns have all their Rings and Traits at 4 (except Fire and Void at 6), roll 8k6 for attacking and damage, and have Brawling 6 and Commerce 5.

Furthermore, all Jinns cannot be slain by mortals: if damaged beyond the Out Wound Rank, the jinn disappears from the world back to the realm from which he was summoned. Most jinns may also change shape at will.

Djinns are divided in several categories, that receive various bonuses depending on their power level.
