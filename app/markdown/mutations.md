#### Beast of Fu Leng

The most terrible of mutations, this causes you to completely lose human form, distorting into a bestial or monstrous body - typically a quadruped or a bloated, ogre-ish humanoid. This severe deformity cannot be hidden, and causes a Fear 1 effect in anyone who sees it.
#### Chitinous Armor

#### Demonic Eyes

Any time you are in darkness or shadow, your eyes glow with an unnatural blue light. This allows you to see through darkness or other visual impairment 'such as smoke or fog).

#### Distorted Limbs

One of your arms or legs, randomly chosen, becomes misshapen or twisted, rendering it useless.

#### Extra Digit

If the digit is cut off, it will regrow within 48 hours.
#### Extra Eye

#### Extra Limb

This limb is obviously Tainted, with discolored skin, claw-like nails, etc. It Is 50% likely to be non-functional, hanging limp from the body, In which case the resulting obstruction and clumsiness causes you to suffer a -1k0 to all Agility-based and Reflexes-based rolls.
