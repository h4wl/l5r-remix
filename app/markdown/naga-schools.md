Title: Naga Schools
---
### <span>Basic Schools</span>

#### <span>Naga Jakla [Shugenja]</span>

The Naga jakla act as conduits of the mysteries of the universe. Jakla learn to use their connection with the Akasha and focus it into displays of powerful magical prowess. They also perform the major religious and spiritual rituals of Naga society, such as the special ritual that makes all Naga immune to the Shadowlands Taint. Only members of the Cobra bloodline can unlock the magic of the <a href="/pearls">Pearls</a> and join the jakla School. Other Bloodlines can sometimes coax magic out of the pearls, but at a greatly reduced power, and in mechanical terms they cannot take this School.

#### <span>Naga Scout [Bushi]</span>

The Naga have always felt at home in the wilderness, and their greatest cities lie within forests and beneath the sea.

## <strong>Techniques:</strong>
#### Rank 1: The Silent Stalker

The Scout is at home within the forest, as comfortable as the animals that reside within. You add +1k0 to all School Skills while inside a forest. Additionally, you may ignore any penalties for wearing light armor.
#### Rank 2: The Great Enemy

The Scout can sense the foul presence of the Shadowlands Taint nearby. You may make an Awareness roll at TN 20 to discern any creature of the Shadowlands or the Nothing within 50’. This TN may be higher if the creature has abilities that obfuscate attempts to fi nd it. This Technique cannot discern any creatures with less than one full Rank in their corruption.
#### Rank 3: Eyes of an Eagle

The Scout learns to spot the minutest details, able to spot even the remnants of a trail in the dead of night. You may spend an Akasha Point to add +4k1 to any Hunting (Tracking) roll.
#### Rank 4: Blackened Sky

The Scout learns to defeat his foes before the enemy is even aware of his presence. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action when using a bow.
#### Rank 5: Relentless Ranger

The Naga Scout learns to push aside the stresses of his own body when on the hunt, relying on the focus of the Akasha to continue beyond his own means. You may function at full capacity without sleep, food, or water for three days. Once these days are past, you must have food and at least four hours of rest to continue functioning at the best of your abilities - otherwise you become Fatigued.
#### <span>Naga Vedic [Courtier]</span>

The Naga Vedics serve many different roles within Naga civilization and hold high positions in their society. Vedics who serve the Bright Eye teach the Naga young and heal the sickly. Vedics who serve the Pale Eye are magistrates who render judgment in disputes between different Naga. No matter what role they play, all Vedics are widely known and respected for their wisdom.

- <strong>Honor:</strong> 6.5
- <strong>Outfit:</strong> Silk Clothing, Hunting Knife, Traveling Pack, 4 (non-magical) Pearls

## <strong>Techniques:</strong>
#### Rank 1: Reflecting Calm

The Vedics are often diplomats and negotiators when situations requre a calm eye and an unshakable mind. You may make a Contested Courtier / Awareness roll to impart the calm of the Akasha on any one target. You gain a bonus of +2k0 to the total of this roll, +3k1 if the target is a Naga. If the roll succeeds, you sway the target’s mood to be more amenable to your position. The target will no longer be combative; if the test occurs during a skirmish, the skirmish immediately ends and the target will attempt to talk through the situation. If anyone else attacks your target or if the talks fail, combat immediately begins once more and your target gains a free Combat Round before normal combat continues. You may not attempt to use this Technique on the same target more than once a day.
#### Rank 2: Arbiter

The Naga Vedics are masters of the laws of Naga society and act as judges when the situation merits. You gain a bonus of +2k1 to the total of any Social rolls with Naga.
#### Rank 3: Heartbeat Of the World

The Naga Vedic attunes himself to the pulse of the world, becoming one with nature itself. You immediately gain one Inner Gift of your choosing (subject to GM’s discretion).
#### Rank 4: Finding Harmony Within

The Vedic is calm at all times, balancing his personal desires with the will of the Akasha. While you are acting in the best interests of the Naga, you gain a bonus of +2k0 to the total of any Social Roll. This Technique stacks with your Rank 2 Technique.
#### Rank 5: Swimming the Depths Of the Akasha

The Vedic is in tune with the desires of the Akasha, and the great consciousness of the Naga wishes to protect its children. You may take a Complex Action to touch a target and suffer Wounds equal to one full Wound Rank. If your target is a Naga, he immediately heals two full Wound Ranks; otherwise, the target heals one full Wound Rank.

If the target suffers from a disease, infection, mental illness, or similar problem, you must immediately make a Stamina roll (at an appropriate TN as set by the GM) or succumb to its effects. However, if the roll is successful, you cleanse the target of the negative effect, whatever it might be. You may not be healed from any diseases or other effects gained from this Technique by any means for a minimum of one full day. The Shadowlands Taint and the Nothing are unaffected by this Technique.
#### <span>Naga Warrior [Bushi]</span>

The backbone of the Naga armies is formed by the Naga Warriors. They are fearless in battle, striking out against impossible odds to defeat the enemies of the Foul. The Naga live in a martial society, and similar training makes the Naga Warrior ready to stand against the greatest Rokugani bushi and fiercest oni without ever backing down.

- <strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Strength
- <strong>Skills:</strong> Defense, Hunting, Kenjutsu, Kyujutsu, Spears (Naga Spear), Lore: Shadowlands, any one Bugei Skill
- <strong>Honor:</strong> 4.5
- <strong>Outfit:</strong> Light or Heavy Armor, Sturdy Clothing, Naga Spear, Bow and Twenty Arrows, any one weapon, Traveling Pack, 3 (non-magical) Pearls

## <strong>Techniques:</strong>
#### Rank 1: the Soul Of the Naga

The first lesson for the Naga Warrior is that he can rely on the Akasha to guide his hand. Once each Turn you may gain a bonus equal to your Akasha Trait to the total of any one roll (except damage rolls). This bonus doubles against enemies of the Naga (Shadowlands creatures, Nothing creatures, Ashalan).
#### Rank 2: High Strike

The Naga Warrior learns to rear to his full height, rising over his comrades in the front lines to strike at the enemy. As a Free Action you may rear onto your tail to tower over your enemies. While you are standing tall in this way, your Armor TN is lowered by 5 but you add +2k0 to all melee attack rolls against targets at ground height. You may drop back to your normal stance in the same Round as a Simple Action, or as a Free Action on a different Round.
#### Rank 3: Chosen Of Qatol

The Naga Warrior is the consummate fighter, never relenting in the face of his enemies. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action while using a weapon with the Naga keyword.
#### Rank 4: The Akasha Protects

The Naga Warrior is never alone, knowing that his connection to the rest of his race cannot be severed. Once per skirmish, you may take a Free Action at the start of any Round to activate this Technique. You gain Reduction equal to your Akasha Trait for 3 full Rounds.
#### Rank 5: Heart of a Warrior

The Naga Warrior never falters or stops, as the Akasha cleanses his soul. You may spend an Akasha Point as a Free Action during your Turn to remove any one Status Effect on yourself. If you are Stunned, you may still use this Technique but it counts as a Simple Action instead.
### <span>Alternative Paths</span>

#### <span>Disciples Of the Dashmar [Courtier]</span>

The Dashmar is the political leader of the Naga, and his benevolent infl uence spreads out among those who admire his abilities. His desire for peace and alliances with other races spreads to his students. The Disciples of The Dashmar are committed to their goals and work tirelessly to connect with foreigners. The Disciples travel far away from the boundaries of the Naga cities, attempting to fi nd common interests with humans. These Disciples often adopt many human customs and become intimately knowledgeable about Rokugan.

- <strong>Technique Rank:</strong> 2
- <strong>Replaces:</strong> Naga Vedic 2
- <strong>Technique:</strong> <em>Friend Of Man</em> - The Disciples of The Dashmar attempt to learn the ways of Rokugan in order to gain new allies against their greatest enemies. You gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of any Social Roll when trying to convince humans of your goodwill or to soothe dangerous situations with humans.

#### <span>Master Bowman [Bushi]</span>

Naga are famed for their archery, even among their enemies. There are few rivals for their excellence among the Rokugani, save perhaps the Tsuruchi of the Mantis Clan. Naga Warriors serve as the front line soldiers in war, but there are plenty who choose to specialize in the art of archery. The Master Bowman is able to strike down his enemies before they ever approach the Naga. He aims his arrows with pinpoint accuracy, striking his targets without fail.

- <strong>Technique Rank:</strong> 3
- <strong>Replaces:</strong> Naga Warrior 3
- <strong>Requires:</strong> Archery 5
- <strong>Technique:</strong> <em>Arrows from the Ranks</em> - The Master Bowman is an artist with his bow, able to strike an opponent in the eye at a thousand paces. You may make attacks as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action when using a bow. Additionally, you may string your bow for use as a Free Action.

#### <span>Pearl Shapers [Shugenja]</span>

Jakla are able to contribute to a Naga war band by using their magical pearls to destroy the enemy. However, these abilities tax the jakla’s concentration and stamina, quickly rendering him unable to fight with any efficacy. The jakla have determined new methods of channeling the latent energy in pearls by focusing them into bolts of magical power.

- <strong>Technique Rank:</strong> 2
- <strong>Replaces:</strong> Naga Jakla 2
- <strong>Technique:</strong> <em>Shards Of Light</em> - Pearl Shapers sacrifi ce their normal magical connections to focus their talents into fi erce magical assaults. They shatter jakla pearls to release their magical energy across the battlefield. As a Complex Action, you may crush any pearl (it does not need to be a jakla spell-pearl) and spend a spell slot of any Element to make a ranged attack against a single target within 100’. Your attack roll is equal to your Agility + (twice your School Rank), keeping your Agility. This attack ignores any armor bonuses to Armor TN. The energy bolt’s damage roll is equal to your Akasha + your School Rank, keeping your Akasha.
