Title: Pearls
---
There are many types of pearls used by the Naga. They have fi gured out different methods of utilizing these pearls over the centuries and have plumbed all of their secrets. The jakla know how to spot the special pearls they use for magic by their glow within the Akasha. Their methods allow them to channel these pearls into powerful magic effects that rival that of any magic created by Rokugani shugenja.<br/>
Elemental pearls are able to simulate the abilities of most of the spells listed in the L5R 4th Edition Core Rulebook. Each pearl is attuned to one of the four elements available to the Naga (Air, Earth, Fire, Water). The pearl’s strength determines what Mastery Level of spell can be placed inside the pearl; a pearl can contain one spell of a Mastery Level equal to or lower than the level of the pearl. For example, a Pearl of Earth Level 2 can hold a single Earth spell of Mastery Level 1 or 2, but nothing higher. These pearls may be used repeatedly without fear of destruction, though their powers may wane if they are overused.<br/>
In addition, there are a few rare and special types of pearls described below, much more limited in number than the elemental pearls handed out to all the jakla. To create a special pearl, the jakla must take an elemental pearl of the appropriate element and alter it to do his bidding, requiring a roll of Spellcraft (Spell Research) / Akasha at a TN equal to 10x the special pearl’s Mastery Level. Once a pearl is altered to become a special pearl, it can no longer be used to cast spells from the L5R 4th Edition Core Rulebook. The exception to this rule is the White Pearl, which can be used to cast multiple spells from the same pearl (see below for details).<br/>
There are no Pearls of Void or Pearls of Akasha. No pearl can ever be used to cast Void or maho spells, and no new pearl created through Spellcraft (Spell Research) can ever simulate Void or maho spell effects.

### <span>Special Pearls</span>

### The Pearl of Cleansing Light
- Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Wards)
- Range: Self
- Area of Effect: 50’
- Duration: Concentration
- Raises: Area of Effect (+10’ per Raise), Special (Willpower TN +5 per 2 Raises)

A light shines upon the caster, illuminating the ground around him. Creatures with at least 1 full rank of Shadowlands Taint or Shadow corruption must make a Willpower roll at TN 20 or immediately run away from the caster. The victims will not stop running until they leave the area of effect. The creature must make the same Willpower roll again if it steps back into the area of effect while the spell is still active.

### The Pearl Of Defense
- Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Defense)
- Range: 5’ or touch
- Area of Effect: 1 target
- Duration: 5 Rounds
- Raises: Duration (+1 Round per Raise)

The target gains scales of steel, preparing him for the enemies that he may face. The target gains Reduction 2, with an additional Reduction 3 against creatures of the Nothing and the Shadowlands (for a total of Reduction 5 against those foes).

### The Pearl of Judgment
- Ring/Mastery: Air 4
- Range: Touch
- Area of Effect: 1 target
- Duration: 1 minute
- Raises: Duration (+1 minute per Raise), Area of Effect (+1 target per Raise)

Naga Vedics are the arbiters of their great cities, but they occasionally require aid when the Akasha cannot determine the truth of the matter at fi rst glance. The Pearl of Judgment allows the caster to link to a single target and achieve a state of complete communication. The caster chooses one willing target for the effects of the Pearl of Judgment.<br/>
If the target is a Naga, the caster may ask the target one yes or no question and know if the answer is truthful.<br/>
If the target is not a Naga, the target can feel the weight and breadth of the Akasha for one brief moment. The caster gains a +3k1 bonus on all Courtier rolls with the target for the duration of the spell. However, the caster does not receive insight into the target’s truthfulness. The sheer size of the Akasha may be disorienting to those who are not prepared for its power, and sometimes leaves the target senseless for many minutes (GM’s discretion).

### The Pearl of Movement
- Ring/Mastery: Water 1
- Range: 25’
- Area of Effect: 1 target
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Raises: Duration (+5 minutes per two Raises)

The Naga pride themselves on their mastery in the element of Water. The jakla can use the Pearl of Movement to instantly increase a Naga’s swimming speed, making him a formidable foe in the underwater Naga cities. The target’s Water Ring is considered to be 2 Ranks higher for the purposes of movement while swimming.

### The Pearl of Swift Retribution
- Ring/Mastery: Fire 3 (Battle)
- Range: Self
- Area of Effect: 25’ radius sphere around caster
- Duration: Concentration
- Raises: Damage (+1k0 per two Raises)

The bow remains the most utilized weapon of the Naga, and the jakla recognize its importance within their culture. The Pearl of Swift Retribution was crafted to aid their efforts in battle. When the jakla focuses his attentions through this pearl, he crafts a spherical bubble of translucent energy.<br/>
When Naga inside the bubble shoot arrows through its surface, the arrows transform into bolts of energy (much like the blasts of light unleashed by the Pearl Shapers). These arrows ignore Armor TN bonuses granted by the target’s armor, and gain a +0k1 damage bonus. The jakla may not move while he is casting and maintaining this spell; any movement immediately cancels the effects.

### The White Pearl
- Ring/Mastery: Air/Earth/Fire/Water 5

The White Pearl is one of the greatest treasures of the Naga civilization. This pearl resides in a place of honor in the most important Naga city of the time. Those who view it swear they can see the whole of the Akasha within its depths. No one knows the true strength of the White Pearl and it has remained unused except for the greatest of crises. A jakla with the White Pearl has access to all spells of every element (except for Void) of Mastery Level 5 or lower. He cannot use this great power to cast Void or maho spells. Unfortunately, such power comes with a price. The jakla must spend two spell slots of the appropriate element for each spell cast through the White Pearl. The jakla may not use Akasha spell slots for spells cast through the White Pearl.
