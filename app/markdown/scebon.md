### <span>Ebonite Templars (Warrior)</span>

The Templars are the basic soldiers of the Order of the Ebon Hand. The order is not particularly large, so its leaders make certain that every warrior among their ranks is well-trained and prepared to face almost any challenge that might present itself. The basic Templar has had several years of training and passed the Test of the Ebon Stone.

### <span>Ebonite Principle</span>

The Principles are the highest ranked members of the Order. They are its officers, leaders and high priests. Each has surrendered part of their own spirit, replacing it with the strength and the power of the Ebon Stone. In doing so, they become something slightly more than human, and steel their soul against manipulation from even the darkest forces.
