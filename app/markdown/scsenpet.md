## <span>Alternate Paths</span>

### <span>Ghul Destroyer</span>

### <span>Ghul Destroyer</span>

The Senpet religion strikes everyone who does not know it intimately as bloody and cruel. Those who practice the worship of the Ten Thousand Gods do not disagree: they simply know it is necessary to maintain the strength of the Empire.

Over the course of the years the Senpet have created and refined the techniques used to destroy those creatures quickly and efficiently.
