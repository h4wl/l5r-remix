### <span>Yodotai Mercenary (Warrior)</span>

Thanks to the Yodotai Mercenary, the Yodotai rarely face a completely different enemies.

### <span>Yodotai Berserker (Warrior)</span>

The Yodotai Berserker throws himself into the thik of battle with little regard for danger. He can do this because of his absolute faith in his comrades and ancestors. He knows that if he performs well in combat, the greatest heroes of the Yodotai will praise his actions and come to his head.
